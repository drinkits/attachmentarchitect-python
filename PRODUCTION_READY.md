## 📋 Complete User Flow

### **Step 1: Setup** (5 minutes)
```bash
# Windows
setup.bat

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Creates virtual environment
- Installs dependencies
- Creates `.env` from template
- Creates necessary directories

### **Step 2: Configure** (2 minutes)
Edit `.env` file:
```env
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-jira.com
JIRA_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

### **Step 3: Test** (30 seconds)
```bash
python test_connection.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ Connected to Jira successfully!
✓ User: John Doe (john.doe)
✓ Authentication working
```

### **Step 4: Scan** (varies by size)
```bash
python jira_dc_scanner.py
```

**What happens:**
1. Connects to Jira ✅
2. Counts issues ✅
3. Scans attachments with progress bar ✅
4. Saves JSON results ✅
5. **Automatically generates HTML report** ✅
6. Displays summary and report path ✅

### **Step 5: View Report** (instant)
Open the HTML file in your browser:
```
./reports/scan_XXXXXXXX_visual_analysis.html
```

**Report includes:**
- 📊 By Project
- 🔍 By File Type
- 👥 By User (Name (username))
- 📅 By Age
- 📋 By Status (Status (ID: X))
- 🔥 Heat Index (sortable, searchable)

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Resume Interrupted Scan
```bash
python jira_dc_scanner.py --resume SCAN_ID
```

### Custom Report Criteria
```bash
python generate_visual_analysis_report.py scan_XXXXXXXX.json --min-size 5 --min-days 180
```

### Custom JQL Queries
Edit `config.yaml`:
```yaml
filters:
  custom_jql: "project = MYPROJECT AND created >= -365d"
```

## 🎯 Production Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Network access to Jira instance
- [ ] Read permissions for issues/attachments
- [ ] Sufficient disk space (~100 MB per 100K attachments)

### Security
- [ ] `.env` file not committed to version control
- [ ] Personal Access Token used (not username/password)
- [ ] Token has minimal required permissions
- [ ] SSL verification enabled (unless self-signed cert)

### Performance Tuning
- [ ] Review `config.yaml` settings
- [ ] Adjust thread pool size based on network
- [ ] Set appropriate rate limits
- [ ] Configure checkpoint interval

### Testing
- [ ] Run `test_connection.py` successfully
- [ ] Test scan on small project first
- [ ] Verify HTML report generates correctly
- [ ] Test resume functionality

## 📊 What Users Get

### Immediate Insights
1. **Total storage** across all projects
2. **Duplicate detection** and wasted space
3. **Top storage consumers** (projects, users, file types)
4. **Frozen Dinosaurs** - Large files on inactive issues
5. **Age distribution** - Identify archival candidates

### Actionable Reports
- **Interactive HTML** - No additional tools needed
- **Sortable tables** - Click any column to sort
- **Search & filter** - Find specific files instantly
- **Visual charts** - Easy to understand at a glance

### Business Value
- 💰 **Cost savings** - Identify storage waste
- 🎯 **Targeted cleanup** - Prioritize high-impact files
- 📈 **Trend analysis** - Understand storage patterns
- 🤝 **Stakeholder reports** - Professional, shareable

---

## 🚀 Performance Benchmarks

### Typical Performance
- **Small instance** (1K-10K issues): 5-15 minutes
- **Medium instance** (10K-100K issues): 30-90 minutes
- **Large instance** (100K-1M issues): 2-8 hours

### Optimization Tips
- **Use URL hashing** for 10x speed (less accurate)
- **Increase thread pool** if network allows
- **Scan during off-hours** to avoid impacting users
- **Use resume** for very large instances

---

## 🛡️ Error Handling

### Graceful Failures
- ✅ Network errors → Retry with fallback
- ✅ Large files → Skip with warning
- ✅ Timeout → Use URL hash fallback
- ✅ Interrupted scan → Save checkpoint
- ✅ API errors → Clear error messages

### Logging
- All errors logged to `./logs/scanner.log`
- Progress saved every 100 issues (configurable)
- Resume from last checkpoint anytime
